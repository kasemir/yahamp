<h2><a name="start">Getting Started</a></h2>
<p>
Before running YAHAMP for the first time,
you need to perform the <a href='#rdb'>Database Setup</a>
described in the following section.
</p>

<h2><a name="rdb">Database Setup</a></h2>
<p>
You need to install MySQL and know its 'root' password.
The free 'Community' version of MySQL, and for that the bare 'essential'
package with database server and command-line client is all that's required.
</p>
<p>
After you install MySQL, create the initial YAHAMP database like this:
<pre>
# Connect to MySQL as 'root', enter your password when prompted.
mysql -u root -p

# Create database
create database yahamp;

# Add user 'yahamp' with password '$yahamp' who can access the 'yahamp' tables
grant all on yahamp.* TO yahamp IDENTIFIED BY '$yahamp';

# Try to connect as that user
# (on MS Windows, do NOT use quotes around $yahamp!)
mysql -u yahamp -p'$yahamp' yahamp

# Create YAHAMP database tables using the file from the 'doc' directory
# (might have to specify the full path to the file
#  which is located under plugins/yahamp.rdb*/dbd)
source create_yahamp.sql
</pre>
</p>


<h2><a name="prefs">Preference Settings</a></h2>
<p>
Edit the file
<code>plugins/yahamp.app*/plugin_customization.ini</code>
</p>


<h2><a name="callbook">Callbook Lookup</a></h2>
<p>
YAHAMP keeps its own call information that allows you
to enter the name or country information for a call sign as
you desire.
For unknown call signs, i.e. call signs for which no information
has been entered into the local callbook, an automated callbook
query to
<a href="http://www.qrz.com/">http://www.qrz.com/</a>
can be used to obtain the essential information: Name, country, ...
</p>
<p>
To allow YAHAMP to access the QRZ database, you need to
obtain a QRZ account and enter your name and password
to the <a href='#prefs'>Preference Settings</a>.
If you have a free, basic account, QRZ will only provide
the user name associated with a call sign.
If you have a subscription to the QRZ XML database,
full location information is available.
</p>


<h2><a name=prefixes>Prefix Information</a></h2>
<p>
YAHAMP uses a CTY.DAT file to obtain prefix information, for example
to determine that call signs starting with "XC..." belong to stations
located in Mexico, DXCC entity "XE".
</p>
<p>
The included doc/cty.dat file was obtained from the web page by Jim Reisert, AD1C,
and the latest version can be downloaded from
<a href="http://www.country-files.com/cty/cty.dat">
http://www.country-files.com/cty/cty.dat</a>
</p>

<h2><a name=flags>Flags</a></h2>
<p>
YAHAMP tries to display a flag for the country of each call sign.
The flags included in YAHAMP are from
<a href="http://www.customicondesign.com/free-icon/">http://www.customicondesign.com/free-icon</a>,
a web site which states:
"All the icons contained in this set are free for non-commercial use."S
</p>


<h2><a name=rigctrl>Rig Control</a></h2>
<p>
A serial line is used to read the current frequency and mode of the radio,
and to set the frequency. On computers that have no serial interface,
a USB-to-Serial interface is required. Some rig interfaces like the
'Rigblaster plug & play' already include such a USB-2-serial converter.
</p>
<p>
The serial port used to connect to the rig must be configured in the
preference settings, using for example "COM4".
</p>

<h3>Yaesu Rigs</h3>
<p>
Supported: FT-817, FT-897, maybe more.
</p>
<p>
CAT must be set to 9600 baud in radio's menu.
</p>

<h3>Icom Rigs</h3>
<p>
Supported: IC-746pro, maybe more.
</p>
<p>
CI-V address of radio must be set to 0x66, baud rate to 9600.
</p>


<h3>Details for Setup of 'GUC232A' USB-to-Serial</h3>
<p>
In the unlikely case that you happen to use this very type
of USB-to-Serial converter...
</p>

<h4>Windows 7</h4>
<p>
Actually worked via Plug-and-Play: Plug, 'yes' to 'look for driver on MS Web Site', OK.
Shows up under Control Panel/System/Hardware/Device Manager "Ports" as "COM3" or "COM4"
depending on which USB port it's plugged into.

<h4>Mac OS X</h4>
<ol>
<li>Get USB-to-serial adapter to work by installing its driver from internet.
    With USB plugged in, there's a new <code>/dev/tty.PL2303-0000103D</code>,
    which vanishes when unplugged.
<li>Set permissions, create the 'lock' directory, add YourUserName to the uucp group:
    <pre>
    chmod 666 /dev/tty.PL2303-0000103D
    mkdir /var/lock
    chgrp uucp /var/lock
    chmod 775 /var/lock
    niutil -readprop / /groups/uucp users
    niutil -mergeprop / /groups/uucp users YourUserName
    niutil -readprop / /groups/uucp users
    </pre>
</ol>
